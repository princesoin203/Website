                <p> Some of the skills I have learnt whilst creating this site includes, Image to site manipulation, Javascript, good website design and various others. The most important skill learnt during the creation of this site is definitely proper
                    website design and how to capture the viewer's attention early. With the use of implementing both images, text and website interactivity to satisfy all types of people. I have also developed skills in learning about different user
                    accessibility options, eg adding lighter colour options in the website to allow people with difficulty reading to have an easier time.

                <h2 style=" color: Grey; text-align:center "> Mistakes I Have Made </h2>
                <p> During the creation of my sites, several mistakes were made which hindered my progress and skewed the intended design of the website. The first mistake I made was forgetting to implement some CSS to have the images on the site to scale
                    with any resolution, during the previous two submissions. This has now been fixed within the CSS. Another mistake was not utilising HTML and CSS online validators to ensure code is written correctly. Using this continuously since the
                    prior two submissions have helped me to clean up my code. Another mistake was not implementing alternate css or adding alt tags for the images to accommodate for people who have difficulty reading and people whose internet service
                    is not as fast to allow alt text to appear in place of images should they not load.
